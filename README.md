# BookStore MVVM Spring JPA Java OOP




<h1> Project Description:</h1>
<p>
The project is a simple online bookstore application that allows users to browse books, add them to a cart, and place orders. The application will use Java, Spring, JPA, Kafka, MVVM architecture, and PostgreSQL database to achieve its functionality.
</p>
<h3>OOP Principles:</h3>

<h4>Inheritance:</h4><p> We can create a base class called "Book" that contains common properties of a book, such as title, author, and publisher. We can then create sub-classes, such as "FictionBook" and "NonFictionBook," that inherit from the "Book" class and add properties specific to each type of book.</p>

<h4>Abstraction:</h4><p> We can use abstraction to hide implementation details from the user. For example, we can create an abstract class called "Payment" that contains common payment-related functionality, such as calculating tax and total cost. We can then create concrete payment classes, such as "CreditCardPayment" and "PaypalPayment," that inherit from the "Payment" class and implement the abstract methods.</p>

<h4>Polymorphism:</h4><p> We can use polymorphism to allow different objects to respond to the same message in different ways. For example, we can create an interface called "Orderable" that contains a method called "placeOrder." Both the "Book" and "Cart" classes can implement the "Orderable" interface, but the implementation of "placeOrder" will be different for each class.</p>

<h4>Encapsulation:</h4> <p>We can use encapsulation to hide implementation details from the user. For example, we can create private instance variables for the "Book" class, such as "title" and "author," and provide public getter and setter methods to access and modify them.</p>

<h3>Connection to Databases using JPA and PostgreSQL:</h3>

<p>We can use the Java Persistence API (JPA) to connect to a PostgreSQL database and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. We can create an entity class called "BookEntity" that maps to a table in the database, and use JPA annotations to define the mapping between the entity class and the database table. We can then use JPA's EntityManager to persist, retrieve, update, and delete instances of the "BookEntity" class.</p>

<h3>Kafka:</h3>

<p>We can use Kafka to implement a publish-subscribe messaging system. When a user places an order, we can use Kafka to publish an order message to a Kafka topic. The order message can contain information about the user, the items ordered, and the total cost. We can then use a Kafka consumer to consume the order message and process it.</p>

<h3>MVVM:</h3>

<p>We can use the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture to structure the application. We can create a "Book" model class that contains information about a book, such as title, author, and price. We can then create a "BookViewModel" class that interacts with the "Book" model class and provides data to the "Book" view. The "Book" view is responsible for displaying the book information to the user.</p>

<h3>Spring:</h3>
<p>
We can use Spring to configure and manage the application. We can use Spring Boot to create a standalone application, and use Spring's Dependency Injection to inject dependencies into the various classes. We can also use Spring's annotations, such as @RestController and @Autowired, to simplify the development process.
</p>
<p>
Overall, this project will require implementing OOP principles, connecting to a PostgreSQL database using JPA, implementing a publish-subscribe messaging system using Kafka, structuring the application using MVVM, and configuring and managing the application using Spring.
